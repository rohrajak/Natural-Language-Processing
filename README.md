# Raw Text Preprocessing

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the fundamental steps in raw text preprocessing for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. It includes importing essential libraries, uploading text data, and applying preprocessing techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, spell correction, and word sense disambiguation.

## Project Goals
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Load and preprocess raw text data.
- Tokenize text into words and sentences.
- Remove stopwords and perform lemmatization.
- Correct spelling errors.
- Apply part-of-speech tagging and word sense disambiguation.

## Dataset
The project is designed to work with any raw text dataset. You can use a `.txt` file containing textual data or scrape text from web sources. Ensure the dataset is in UTF-8 format for compatibility.

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Install Required Libraries
### 2. Download NLTK Resources
### 3. Run the Preprocessing Script
Execute the script that includes:
- Importing libraries.
- Loading text data.
- Tokenizing sentences and words.
- Removing stopwords.
- Applying lemmatization and spell correction.
- Using word sense disambiguation.

You can integrate this script into your NLP pipeline or modify it to fit specific text preprocessing needs.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute by optimizing the preprocessing steps or adding new features like Named Entity Recognition (NER) or text normalization.
